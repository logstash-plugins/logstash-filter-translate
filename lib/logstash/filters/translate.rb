# A general search and replace tool which uses a configured hash
# and/or a file to determine replacement values. Currently supported are 
# YAML, JSON and CSV files.
#
# The dictionary entries can be specified in one of two ways: First,
# the `dictionary` configuration item may contain a hash representing
# the mapping. Second, an external file (readable by logstash) may be specified
# in the `dictionary_path` configuration item. These two methods may not be used
# in conjunction; it will produce an error.
#
# Operationally, if the event field specified in the `field` configuration
# matches the EXACT contents of a dictionary entry key (or matches a regex if
# `regex` configuration item has been enabled), the field's value will be substituted
# with the matched key's value from the dictionary.
#
# By default, the translate filter will replace the contents of the 
# maching event field (in-place). However, by using the `destination`
# configuration item, you may also specify a target event field to
# populate with the new translated value.
# 
# Alternatively, for simple string search and replacements for just a few values
# you might consider using the gsub function of the mutate filter.

class LogStash::Filters::Translate < LogStash::Filters::Base
  config_name "translate"

  # The name of the logstash event field containing the value to be compared for a
  # match by the translate filter (e.g. `message`, `host`, `response_code`). 
  # 
  # If this field is an array, only the first value will be used.
  config :field, :validate => :string, :required => true

  # If the destination (or target) field already exists, this configuration item specifies
  # whether the filter should skip translation (default) or overwrite the target field
  # value with the new translation value.
  config :override, :validate => :boolean, :default => false

  # The dictionary to use for translation, when specified in the logstash filter
  # configuration item (i.e. do not use the `@dictionary_path` file)
  # Example:
  # [source,ruby]
  #     filter {
  #       %PLUGIN% {
  #         dictionary => [ "100", "Continue",
  #                         "101", "Switching Protocols",
  #                         "merci", "thank you",
  #                         "old version", "new version" ]
  #       }
  #     }
  # NOTE: it is an error to specify both `dictionary` and `dictionary_path`
  config :dictionary, :validate => :hash,  :default => {}

  # The full path of the external dictionary file. The format of the table
  # should be a standard YAML, JSON or CSV. Make sure you specify any integer-based keys
  # in quotes. For example, the YAML file should look something like this:
  # [source,ruby]
  #     "100": Continue
  #     "101": Switching Protocols
  #     merci: gracias
  #     old version: new version
  #
  # NOTE: it is an error to specify both `dictionary` and `dictionary_path`
  # NOTE: Currently supported formats are YAML, JSON and CSV, format selection is
  # based on the file extension, json for JSON, (yaml|yml) for YAML and csv for CSV.
  # NOTE: The JSON format only supports simple key/value, unnested objects. The CSV
  # format expects exactly two columns with the first serving as the original text,
  # the second column as the replacement
  config :dictionary_path, :validate => :path

  # When using a dictionary file, this setting will indicate how frequently
  # (in seconds) logstash will check the dictionary file for updates.
  config :refresh_interval, :validate => :number, :default => 300

  # The destination field you wish to populate with the translated code. The default
  # is a field named `translation`. Set this to the same value as source if you want
  # to do a substitution, in this case filter will allways succeed. This will clobber
  # the old value of the source field! 
  config :destination, :validate => :string, :default => "translation"

  # When `exact => true`, the translate filter will populate the destination field
  # with the exact contents of the dictionary value. When `exact => false`, the
  # filter will populate the destination field with the result of any existing
  # destination field's data, with the translated value substituted in-place.
  #
  # For example, consider this simple translation.yml, configured to check the `data` field:
  # [source,ruby]
  #     foo: bar
  #
  # If logstash receives an event with the `data` field set to `foo`, and `exact => true`,
  # the destination field will be populated with the string `bar`.

  # If `exact => false`, and logstash receives the same event, the destination field
  # will be also set to `bar`. However, if logstash receives an event with the `data` field
  # set to `foofing`, the destination field will be set to `barfing`.
  #
  # Set both `exact => true` AND `regex => `true` if you would like to match using dictionary
  # keys as regular expressions. A large dictionary could be expensive to match in this case. 
  config :exact, :validate => :boolean, :default => true

  # If you'd like to treat dictionary keys as regular expressions, set `exact => true`.
  # Note: this is activated only when `exact => true`.
  config :regex, :validate => :boolean, :default => false

  # In case no translation occurs in the event (no matches), this will add a default
  # translation string, which will always populate `field`, if the match failed.
  #
  # For example, if we have configured `fallback => "no match"`, using this dictionary:
  # [source,ruby]
  #     foo: bar
  #
  # Then, if logstash received an event with the field `foo` set to `bar`, the destination
  # field would be set to `bar`. However, if logstash received an event with `foo` set to `nope`,
  # then the destination field would still be populated, but with the value of `no match`.
  # This configuration can be dynamic and include parts of the event using the `%{field}` syntax.
  config :fallback, :validate => :string
